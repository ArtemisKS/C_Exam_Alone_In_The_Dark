# C_Exam_Alone_In_The_Dark
C Exam, some facile but interesting exercises, limited by time and norm

## Some ~~exemplary~~ coding from C_Exam of 42 school, done in a dreadful style, to be honest, but correct nonetheless
**Here are some ~~stupid~~ _interesting_ tasks, which can be found int this rep: **
* check_mate
* rpn_calc
* infin_add
* brackets
* biggest_pal
* count_alpha
* count_island

```
Beg my pardon for the limited number of tasks, all due to the mysteriously disappeared traces..
